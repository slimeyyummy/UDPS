> A lightweight, reliable, congestion-aware protocol built on top of raw UDP — inspired by QUIC, TCP, and BBR.

## 📖 Project Overview

The **UDPS Protocol** is a modern take on reliable transport over UDP. Designed for learning, testing, and potentially secure communication, it includes:

-  3-Way Handshake
-  Reliable, ordered packet delivery
-  Out-of-order packet buffering
-  Retransmission & timeout (60ms)
-  BBR-inspired congestion control
-  XOR encryption (demo only)
-  Modular client/server design
