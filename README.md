UDPS Protocol (UDP-based Reliable Protocol)This project implements a custom UDP-based reliable protocol, inspired by concepts from modern transport protocols like QUIC and BBR. It provides a foundation for building applications that require reliable, ordered, and potentially encrypted data transfer over UDP, overcoming the inherent unreliability of raw UDP.✅ What this project doesThe UDPS Protocol aims to demonstrate the core mechanisms required to build a reliable transport layer on top of UDP. It includes:3-Way Handshake: A secure connection establishment process similar to TCP's 3-way handshake, extended for conceptual key exchange.Reliable Data Transfer: Ensures that all data packets sent are eventually received by the peer, handling packet loss and reordering.Packet Reordering Buffer: Buffers out-of-order packets at the receiver to deliver data to the application in the correct sequence.Retransmission Mechanism: Identifies and retransmits lost packets based on timeouts.BBR-inspired Congestion Control: A simplified implementation of BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) to estimate network conditions and dynamically adjust sending rates to maximize throughput and minimize latency.Conceptual Encryption: A basic XOR-based pseudo-encryption mechanism to demonstrate how data confidentiality can be integrated, leveraging a conceptual key exchange during the handshake.Client-Server Architecture: Provides separate executables for a client and a server, allowing for easy testing of the protocol's functionality.✅ How to buildThis project is written in C++ and uses standard socket programming interfaces. It can be built on both Windows (using MinGW/MSVC) and Linux/macOS (using GCC/Clang).PrerequisitesA C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)make (for Linux/macOS/MinGW) or Visual Studio (for MSVC on Windows)Building on Linux/macOS (using g++)Open your terminal.Navigate to the project directory (where udps.cpp is located).Compile the source code:g++ udps.cpp -o udps -std=c++17 -pthread


-o udps: Specifies the output executable name as udps.-std=c++17: Enables C++17 features used in the code (e.g., std::chrono::steady_clock).-pthread: Links against the POSIX threads library, necessary for std::thread, std::mutex, and std::condition_variable.Building on Windows (using MinGW g++)Ensure MinGW is installed and its bin directory is in your system's PATH.Open Git Bash or Command Prompt.Navigate to the project directory.Compile the source code:g++ udps.cpp -o udps.exe -std=c++17 -lws2_32 -lwsock32 -pthread


-lws2_32 -lwsock32: Links against the Windows Sockets libraries (ws2_32.lib and wsock32.lib), which are required for network programming on Windows.-pthread: Links against the pthreads-win32 library if using a MinGW distribution that includes it. Some MinGW versions might not strictly require -pthread for std::thread, but it's good practice.Building on Windows (using MSVC - Visual Studio)Open Visual Studio.Create a new "Empty Project" (C++).Add udps.cpp to the project's Source Files.Configure Project Properties:Go to Project > Properties.C/C++ > Language > C++ Language Standard: Set to ISO C++17 Standard (/std:c++17).Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies: Add Ws2_32.lib.Build the project.✅ Example usageAfter building, you will have an executable named udps (or udps.exe on Windows).1. Start the ServerOpen a terminal/command prompt and run:./udps server <listen_port> [encryption_key]


<listen_port>: The port number the server will listen on (e.g., 8080).[encryption_key]: (Optional) A string to enable conceptual encryption. If provided, both client and server must use the same key.Example:./udps server 8080 mysecretkey


You should see output similar to:Server: Listening on port 8080 (0.0.0.0:8080)
Server: Running. Waiting for clients. Type 'quit' to exit. Type 'send <conn_id> <message>' to echo.


2. Start the ClientOpen another terminal/command prompt and run:./udps client <server_ip> <server_port> [encryption_key]


<server_ip>: The IP address of the server (e.g., 127.0.0.1 for localhost).<server_port>: The port number the server is listening on (e.g., 8080).[encryption_key]: (Optional) The same string as used for the server to enable conceptual encryption.Example:./udps client 127.0.0.1 8080 mysecretkey


You should see output similar to:Client: Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:8080
Client: Sending SYN (Seq: 1) - Attempt 1
Client: Received SYN-ACK (ConnID: 1, Seq: 123, Ack: 2)
Client: Derived shared encryption key (conceptual).
Client: Sending Handshake Finished ACK (ConnID: 1, Seq: 2, Ack: 124)
Client: Connection established (Handshake Step 3 complete) with ConnID: 1
Client: Type messages to send. Type 'quit' to exit.


3. Send MessagesFrom Client: Type a message in the client terminal and press Enter.You: Hello server!


The client will send this message to the server.From Server (Echo): The server can receive messages and, if desired, send a message back to a specific client using the send command.Server: send 1 Hello client, I received your message!


(Replace 1 with the actual ConnID shown in the server logs when the client connected).✅ Protocol overviewThe UDPS Protocol implements several key features to provide reliability and congestion control over UDP:Packet Structure (UDPSPacket)#pragma pack(push, 1)
struct UDPSPacket {
    uint8_t flag;       // Type of packet (SYN, ACK, DATA, FIN, PING, HEARTBEAT, REKEY)
    uint16_t conn_id;   // Connection/session ID
    uint32_t seq;       // Sequence number for the sender's stream
    uint32_t ack;       // Acknowledgment number for the receiver's stream (cumulative ACK)
    uint16_t length;    // Length of the payload data
    char data[PAYLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE]; // Payload buffer (512 bytes)
};
#pragma pack(pop)


Flag MeaningsSYN (0x01): Synchronization. Used by the client to initiate a new connection (ClientHello).ACK (0x02): Acknowledgment. Used to confirm receipt of packets and carry acknowledgment numbers. Also used in SYN-ACK and FIN-ACK.DATA (0x03): Carries application-layer data.FIN (0x04): Finish. Used to gracefully terminate a connection.PING (0x05): Used for liveness checks and RTT measurement.HEARTBEAT (0x06): (Conceptual) For maintaining connection liveness over longer periods.REKEY (0x07): (Conceptual) For re-establishing encryption keys periodically.Handshake (3-Way)Client -> Server: SYN (ClientHello): Client sends a SYN packet with its initial sequence number and a conceptual "public key" in the payload.Server -> Client: SYN-ACK (ServerHello): Server responds with a SYN-ACK packet acknowledging the client's SYN, assigns a conn_id, includes its own initial sequence number, and a conceptual "public key" in the payload.Client -> Server: ACK (Handshake Finished ACK): Client sends an ACK packet acknowledging the server's SYN-ACK. The payload contains a special HANDSHAKE_FINISHED_MSG to signal completion of its handshake part. At this point, both client and server derive a shared encryption key, and the connection is fully established.Encryption (xor_encrypt_decrypt)A basic XOR cipher is used for conceptual encryption. If an encryption_key is provided during client/server initialization, data payloads are XORed with this key before sending and after receiving. This is a demonstration of where encryption would fit into the protocol and is not cryptographically secure for real-world use. In a production system, this would be replaced by robust ciphers like AES, derived from a strong key exchange (e.g., TLS 1.3 over DTLS).Retransmission Strategy (Timeout-based)Both the client and server maintain a map of "unacknowledged packets." If a packet is sent and its acknowledgment is not received within UDPS_TIMEOUT_MS (60ms), it is marked for retransmission. This is a simple timeout-based retransmission.Packet ReorderingBoth client and server implement a reorder_buffer (a std::map<uint32_t, UDPSPacket>) to handle out-of-order packet arrival. If a packet arrives with a sequence number greater than the next_expected_seq, it is buffered. When the next_expected_seq packet arrives, it (and any subsequently buffered in-order packets) are delivered to the application.BBR-like Congestion ControlA simplified BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) inspired algorithm is implemented to dynamically adjust the sending rate and inflight data.min_rtt_us: Tracks the minimum Round-Trip Time observed, representing the propagation delay.delivery_rate_bytes_per_ms: Estimates the bottleneck bandwidth by tracking acknowledged bytes over time.bytes_in_flight: The amount of data sent but not yet acknowledged.pacing_rate_bytes_per_ms: The rate at which new packets are released into the network.bbr_state: Transitions through STARTUP, DRAIN, PROBE_BW, and PROBE_RTT phases.STARTUP: Aggressively increases pacing_rate to find available bandwidth.DRAIN: Reduces pacing_rate to drain any queue built up during STARTUP.PROBE_BW: Cycles through gain factors to maintain high throughput and periodically probe for more bandwidth.PROBE_RTT: Periodically reduces bytes_in_flight to a minimal level to measure the true min_rtt without queuing delay.The pacing_rate_bytes_per_ms and target_inflight (congestion window) are adjusted based on these estimates and the current BBR state to optimize for both throughput and low latency. A minimum inflight window is maintained to ensure initial packets can always be sent, allowing the BBR algorithm to bootstrap.✅ LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.MIT License
