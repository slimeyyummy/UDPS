> A lightweight, reliable, congestion-aware protocol built on top of raw UDP â€” inspired by QUIC, TCP, and BBR.

##  Project Overview

The **UDPS Protocol** is a modern take on reliable transport over UDP. Designed for learning, testing, and potentially secure communication, it includes:

-  3-Way Handshake
-  Reliable, ordered packet delivery
-  Out-of-order packet buffering
-  Retransmission & timeout (60ms)
-  BBR-inspired congestion control
-  XOR encryption (demo only)
-  Modular client/server design

##  How to Build

###  Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler: GCC, Clang, or MSVC
- Windows or Linux/macOS environment
- `make` (Unix) or Visual Studio (Windows)

---

###  Linux/macOS

```bash
g++ udps.cpp -o udps -std=c++17 -pthread
```

### Windows

```
g++ udps.cpp -o udps.exe -std=c++17 -lws2_32 -lwsock32 -pthread
```
